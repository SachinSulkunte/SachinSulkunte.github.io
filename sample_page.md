## NuCare: iOS Informational Application for Nuclear Medicine Protocols

**Project description:** I completed this project as an intern with the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, during the summer of 2018. I, along with two other interns, worked to develop a self-guided project within the Office of Nuclear Material Safety and Safeguards. After researching the nuclear medicine field and the role the NRC plays in regulating it, I proposed that we develop a mobile application. The purpose of such an application would be to provide an accessible and integrated information source regarding nuclear medicine and specifically the safety regulations imposed by the NRC to ensure both patients and others in the process are as safe as possible.

### 1. Suggest hypotheses about the causes of observed phenomena

```Java
if (isAwesome){
  return true
}
```

### 2. Assess assumptions on which statistical inference will be based

```javascript
if (isAwesome){
  return true
}
```

### 3. Support the selection of appropriate statistical tools and techniques

### 4. Provide a basis for further data collection through surveys or experiments
