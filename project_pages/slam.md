### SLAM Implementation

This is a work in progress. Having built the sensor simulation, my next step is to define line features using a feature extraction algorithm similar to the one described in the paper below. This will operate on the raw LIDAR data generated by my LIDAR simulation. This information will allow me to take the raw LIDAR data and extract features in order to return a full defined-map based on the 2D point data which could be used for navigation.
