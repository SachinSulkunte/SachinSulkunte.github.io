### VR-Controlled 6DOF Robotic Manipulator

Thanks for your interest! This is my latest project and the original goal was to design and build a 6DOF robotic arm, similar in style to the UR3 commerical robot. I then came up with the concept of integrating a VR controller to add more intuitive controls to the arm.

Due to the new semester starting and a heavy courseload, I haven't updated this page with code or videos of the system yet. If you're interested in learning more, please feel free to contact me at sulkunte@gmail.com!
