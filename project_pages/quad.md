### Quadruped Robot
Currently working on reinforcement-learning based gait creation in a simulation environment. I will update this page with progress soon!

Here are some videos from my simulation environment using the PyBullet physics engine. Various parameters can be adjusted using the sliders on the side. I intend on conducting further testing of gaits as I move further in the project.
