### AR Wearable

## Motivation
I've been intrigued with Mixed Reality lately, especially with the release of the Apple Vision Pro and evolution of devices like Meta Quest 3. I wanted to design a basic AR device that would let me see a semi-transparent display overlay. 

## Scope
- Single eye display
- Wired connection to device (laptop, phone, other HDMI-compatible device)
- Semi-transparent display - combiner
- Ability to run apps from physical tags (i.e. AprilTags)

## Model
I am currently working on making a CAD model while I wait for parts to be delivered!

## Software
I am working on using Unity as a tool for generating the AR content. Check back in later to see my progress!
