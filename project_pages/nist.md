# 3D Vision Systems and Emergency Response Robots

I worked as a part-time intern with NIST's Intelligent Systems Division during my sophomore year of college. I engaged in a project dedicated to the development of standards related to 3D vision systems in the manufacturing industry. I worked with several industry-grade 3D-vision solutions in addition to a custom vision platform for benchmark testing. Specifically, I wrote code to integrate these systems with both a KUKA iiwr robotic arm as well as a UR5e robotic arm.
