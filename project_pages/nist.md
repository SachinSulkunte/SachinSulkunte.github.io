# 7-DOF Robotic Arm
I am currently working as a part-time intern with NIST's Intelligent Systems Division. My job entails developing and implementing machine learning algorithms and integrating 3D sensors and 360° cameras on a mobile emergency response robot to allow it to autonomously open doors. Some of my specific tasks involve:
- Using ROS to control a mobile robot with a 7-DOF manipulator
- Integrating an Intel RealSense sensor and a Theta 360° camera in ROS/Unity (in Windows) on the robot
- Integrating an Oculus Rift VR headset with ROS/Unity to display an augmented reality view overlayed with the RealSense data
