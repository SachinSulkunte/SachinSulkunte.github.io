## Autonomous Vehicle

**Project description:** I completed this project in order to apply a variety of skills to the development of a complex electromechanical system with autonomous capabilities. This "self-driving car" was built as a 4-motor differential drive robot for mechanical simplicity. A Jetson Nano is used for high-level decision making based on input from a RGBD-camera. An Arduino is treated as a client of the Nano, receiving instructions for motor control.
