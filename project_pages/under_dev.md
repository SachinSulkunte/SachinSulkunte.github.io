## These Projects Are Currently Under Development
Thank you for your interest in my work! I currently have three main projects in development.

# Gesture Controller
This is a machine learning project that is currently 80% completed. The main purpose is to enable users who might have trouble using a mouse to navigate their computers with ease. Using hand tracking modules from MediaPipe as well as gesture recognition models I trained, users are able to use a variety of recognized gestures to open up specific applications, adjust computer volume, or switch between tabs easily.

# AWS S3 + Elasticsearch Front-end
This project was completed during my internship with Praxis Engineering. I have not yet compiled code samples and images for display although it will occur soon. The developed webpage utilizes API endpoints set in Amazon Web Services Lambda to run python programs when actions are taken (i.e. clicking a button). These python programs interface with AWS S3, allowing me to pull data stored in S3 buckets as well as interface with Elasticsearch, a NoSQL database. The user is able to upload data to the databases through the webpage as well as list all current data. They can also search for data by terms through the use of a fuzzysearch in the Elasticsearch API.
